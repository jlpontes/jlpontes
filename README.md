# Hello World!
As a Computer Engineering student at the Federal University of São Paulo (Unifesp) pursuing a double degree, I have built a strong academic and professional foundation in technology and innovation. My career launched at my university's junior enterprise, where I honed my skills in Data Science.

Currently, I am an intern in the IBM Power division, where my daily responsibilities include managing high-demand IBM Power servers running Linux, OpenShift, and Cloud environments (PowerVS). This role allows me to combine my technical knowledge with my passion and business vision, implementing AI solutions on mission-critical servers to meet clients’ needs.

Passionate about the potential of AI, I dedicate my personal time to Data Science projects involving Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. At IBM, I actively leverage cutting-edge technologies like Watsonx.ai and Watson Orchestrate. My projects include developing data-driven solutions, using AI agents with Watson Orchestrate for workflow automation, and performing analyses for investment and credit card fraud detection.
