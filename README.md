# Hello World!
Computer Engineering student at Unifesp with a strong passion for technology, innovation, and business impact. I began my journey through active involvement in the university's junior enterprise, developing skills in data analysis, strategic planning, and systems development.

I am currently an intern at IBM in the POWER division, working on high-impact projects that explore the potential of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Watsonx.ai. I'm actively involved in developing data-driven solutions and leveraging AI agents using Watson Orchestrate to automate and optimize workflows. My work involves applying in-demand market technologies such as Linux, OpenShift, and Cloud environments, while also integrating technical knowledge with a business perspective. This experience allows me to deepen my expertise and develop practical skills that are crucial for operating mission-critical systems and deploying advanced AI solutions in enterprise settings.
see yah,
