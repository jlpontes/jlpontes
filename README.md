# Hello World!,
Computer Engineering student at Unifesp with a strong passion for technology, innovation, and business impact. I began my journey through active involvement in the university's junior enterprise, developing skills in data analysis, strategic planning, and systems development.

Currently, I am an intern at IBM in the POWER division, where I work on high-impact projects involving Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Watsonx.ai on Power Systems. My work integrates technical and business perspectives, leveraging technologies like Linux, OpenShift, and Cloud environments. I continuously deepen my expertise in POWER systems and their role in enabling critical enterprise operations.

see yah,
